## 1. Work Completed

### **Backend**

- **Password Reset & Email Verification**
  - Integrated Twilio SendGrid for secure password reset via email verification codes.
  - Implemented endpoints for sending, verifying, and consuming password reset codes, with JWT-based reset tokens for enhanced security.
  - Added code expiry and single-use logic to prevent replay attacks.

- **Appointment and Profile Enhancements**
  - Ensured all appointment endpoints return an empty array instead of `null`, fixing blank page issues in the frontend.

- **Timezone and Security Fixes**
  - Standardized all timestamps to UTC for reliable expiry and scheduling.
  - Enhanced input validation and error responses across all endpoints.

### **Frontend**

- **Forgot Password Flow**
  - Complete UI for “Forgot Password” with stepwise email, code verification, and password reset.
  - Integrated with new backend endpoints for send code, verify code, and password reset.
  - Improved error and success feedback for all steps, including parsing backend error messages for user-friendly alerts.

- **Testing & Quality**
  - Added/updated Cypress end-to-end tests for password reset, appointment management, and doctor profile flows.
  - Expanded React Testing Library unit tests for new and updated components.
  - Refactored test structure for maintainability and coverage.

- **General UI/UX**
  - **Consistent Styling** – Uniform shadows, borders, and rounded corners.
  - **Interactive Hover States** – Buttons/cards with smooth animations.
  - **Icon Integration** – Relevant icons for better visual cues.
  - **Focus Indicators** – Glow/highlight for active form fields.
  - **Gradient Accents** – Buttons/headers with subtle gradients.
  - **Responsive Typography** – Font sizes that adapt to screen size.
  - **Micro-Interactions** – Small animations (e.g., hover, focus).
  - **Clear Visual Hierarchy** – Bold headings with divider accents.
  - **Accessible Contrast** – Readable text and color choices.
  - Improved loading states, error alerts, and empty state messaging.
  - Enhanced accessibility and responsive design across all main pages.

## 3. Frontend Unit & Cypress Tests

## **FrontEnd E2E Testing**

### Overview
In Sprint 4, Unit tests and Cypress E2E testing was used as the primary testing framework to ensure the quality and functionality of various features in the application. Cypress's ability to perform end-to-end, integration, and unit testing directly in the browser made it an ideal choice for validating user workflows and application behavior.

### Why Cypress?
Cypress was chosen for its unique features and benefits:

- **Real-Time Reloads:** Automatically reruns tests upon saving, speeding up development.
- **Automatic Waiting:** Eliminates the need for explicit waits by waiting for DOM elements, animations, and AJAX calls to complete.
- **Ease of Debugging:** Provides detailed logs and snapshots for debugging failed tests.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Supports testing across multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- **All-in-One Framework:** Combines test writing, execution, and debugging in a single tool.
